<h2>Education about Web Technology</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this page is promote awareness of the information exchanged online.
What is shown here is not acquired through any gimmickry or elaborate hacking.
It relies on a regular <a href="https://github.com/episphere/hello/blob/master/index.js" target="_blank">function</a> as a service (FaaS) <a href="https://us-central1-nih-nci-dceg-episphere-dev.cloudfunctions.net/helloMe" target="_blank">hosted</a> by a regular Cloud provider.
<b>What you see below is the information you, yourself, provide everytime you click on a link</b>.
In my oppinion, this should be discussed without alarm or libel, as education about the nature of the Web as a global village.
That is, a place where we are not annonymous, which diminishes our privacy, but also creates entirely new opportunities for collective awareness.
